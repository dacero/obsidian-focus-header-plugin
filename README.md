# Focus header plugin

An Obsidian plugin that does 3 things:

- Focus on current header: it will fold every other header in the document allowing you to focus on the current one.
- Focus on next header: it will move to the next sibling header, unfolding it and folding everything else.
- Focus on previous header.

I take meeting notes in my daily file.

Each meeting is a level 2 heading.

I found myself reviewing the notes at the end of the day, but the clutter of all notes available was a bit distracting.

With this plugin, I can reduce noise, concentrate on a specific meeting note, then move to the next.

It helps my focus.
